📄 Privacy Policy – History Experience: Alhambra

Last Updated: 12/02/2026

1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains the privacy practices of the application History Experience: Alhambra (“we”, “us”, “our”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any information you might provide.

This app is designed so that it does not collect, store, or share any personal information from users.

2. No Personal Data Collection

We do not collect, store, process, or share any personal information, including but not limited to:

Names

Email addresses

Phone numbers

Device identifiers

Usage history or analytics

No personal data is transmitted to our servers, third-party services, or any external systems.

3. App Permissions and Technical Requirements

The following Android permissions may appear in the app’s manifest due to the way Unreal Engine builds Android applications:

📌 These permissions are required by Unreal Engine’s default Android build process and are included automatically when packaging the app. The engine currently does not provide a setting to remove them individually without modifying core build behavior.

The permissions may include:

android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

android.permission.READ_MEDIA_AUDIO

android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO

android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES

android.permission.ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION

android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED

These permissions are present because Android’s build system and Unreal Engine merge multiple required entries by default when external media access is involved, and there is no exposed project setting to disable them without modifying engine source.

Important:
Even though these permissions are included in the manifest:

✔ They are only used for the internal technical operation of the app.
✔ They do not result in personal data collection, transmission, or sharing.
✔ They are not used to track users or identify individuals.

4. Use of Permissions

If the app requests access at runtime, it is only to satisfy the Android operating system requirements for media access when users explicitly interact with features that would need it (e.g., selecting a file). At no point do we collect or send data beyond the device. The app’s functionality works locally.

This ensures the app remains privacy‑preserving and respectful of user data.

5. Third‑Party Content

The app may contain links to external websites or resources not controlled by us. We are not responsible for their privacy practices. Please refer to the privacy policies of those sites if you visit them.

6. Contact

7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are made, the “Last Updated” date at the top will be revised.
